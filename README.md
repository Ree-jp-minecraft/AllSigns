To create a command sign which executes a specific command when a player touches it, just create a sign like this and touch it.

Write the sign like that:  
1. command  
2. anything like a description of the command or leave blank 
3. the first part of the command  
4. the second part of the command  

So when you are writing your sign like this, it'll execute the command "help". 
1. command
2. this is a test description 
3. help  
4. nothing (leave blank) 

And when you're writing your sign like that, it'll also execute the command "help".  
1. command
2. this is a test description 
3. he  
4. lp 

### üåé Teleport Signs
To create a world sign which teleports a player to a specific world when he touches and is showing how many players are in the world, just create a sign like this and touch it.

1. world  
2. the name of the world (e.g. lobby) 
3. anything like a description of the world or leave blank
